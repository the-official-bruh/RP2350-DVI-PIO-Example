Example of RP2350 running the DVI PIO Display Library (Does not use HSTX module)
This configuration has been modified to properly configure the pins for use with the Adafruit DVI Sock.
For some reason, the DVI sock config is normally broken and will not output to the display. Reference the libdvi files to understand the change.
